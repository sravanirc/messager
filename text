Project - front end , backend (MERN) M- MongoDB , E- Express js(Backend server) ,
 R- React (frontend client) , N- Node.js (environment)
Nodejs: Node. js is the runtime environment for execution of JavaScript code on the server side, coordinating communication between front-end and back-end components.

Step -1 : npm init -y : This will intialise a javascript project , -y is for yes to accept default values - This will create a package.json file.
step 2: install and update dependencies - express, mongoose, nodemon
spet 3: use Express to create server 
    3.1 Import express 
    3.2 call const app = express()
    3.3 app.listen() // this will start the server
    3.4: app.get or app.post, app.delete, app.create can be used to create paths or routing
    3.5: app.use(express.json()) - This will let us acess req body
    3.6 : to access and send req body back as respones user JSON.stringify(req.body)
